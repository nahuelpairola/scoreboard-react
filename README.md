# Score Board

This project was developed with React and you can use it on https://thriving-twilight-fa0e7a.netlify.app/. It was designed
to uset it locally.

## Git Clone

You can clone this repo using the command

```
git clone https://github.com/nahuelpairola/scoreboard-react.git
```

Then run the commands:

```
cd src
npm install
npm start
```

And **VOILÃ€ !** you're running your own score board for three matches :)

## How does it works?

**It's really simple:** You have three matches, each one works individually. To increase, decrease or reset (go to zero) you just move your mouse to the points and the buttons came up. When the firts team gets the match score the game is finished and a beatiful mutting color window over the match appers showing us **THE WINNER**, and a button to reaload the game.

A few **options** : in the upper right corner in each match you'll find two buttons:

**Time** 5 minutes for practice, with play, pause and stop/reset buttons.

**Configuration** : where you can modify team names and the maximal match score. Two buttons are provided, one to save
the new data and other to reset data by default.

If you find something wrong or something is not working, please just let me know.

**ENJOY IT :)**

**_PS_**: in **src/App.js** you can add more matches if you wish :)
