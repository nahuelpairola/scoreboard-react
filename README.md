# Score Board

This project was developed with React and you can use it on https://thriving-twilight-fa0e7a.netlify.app/.

## How run it locally

You can clone this repo using the command

`git clone https://github.com/nahuelpairola/scoreboard-react.git`

Load the **src** folder and run the command

`npm start`

And **VOILÀ !** you're running your own score board for three matches :)

## How does it works?

**It's really simple:** You have three matches, each one works individually. To increase, decrease or reset (go to zero) you
just move your mouse to the points and the buttons came up. When the firts team gets the match score the game is finished and
a beatiful mutting color window over the match appers showing us **THE WINNER**, and a button to realoa the game.

A few 'options': in the right upper corner of each match you'll find two buttons:

**Time ->** Practice Time: 5 minutes for practice, with play, pause and stop/reset buttons.
**Configuration ->** where you can modify team names and the maximal match score.

If you find something wrong or something is not working, please let me know.

ENOJOY IT :)

PS: in **src/App.js** you can add more matches if you wish :)
